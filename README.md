# Donald Trump v. Hillary Clinton -- Twitter Word Clouds #
*This is a work in progress, I'm refining things as there are obviously some false positives ("don", "ly", dtrump", and things like that). Keep in mind that this is coming from Twitter data, and from Donald Trump's twitter no less, so there is surely going to be some wonkiness in the results.*

I created this word cloud from 3223 tweets by <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank">@realDonaldTrump</a> (yes, that is his actual twitter account name), and 3244 tweets by <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton" target="_blank">@HillaryClinton</a>. It's not as salacious as I had hoped, but none the less pretty interesting.

Special thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy" target="_blank">tweepy</a> module for accessing twitter data in python, <a href="https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496" target="_blank">yanofsky's</a> script to download twitter posts to CSV, and finally to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gruevyhat/d/kzaman/how-isis-uses-twitter/militant-extremist-wordcloud" target="_blank">gruevyhat's</a> for his inspiration after he created the militant extremist word cloud.
